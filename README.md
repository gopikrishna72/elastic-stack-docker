# stack-docker
This example Docker Compose configuration demonstrates many components of the
Elastic Stack, all running on a single machine under Docker.

## Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose.
  * Windows and Mac users get Compose installed automatically
with Docker for Windows/Mac.

  * Ensure that docker-compose version >= 1.21.0,
    * Compose introduced a bug wrt project names stripping out hyphens and underscores that was fixed in 1.21.0

  * Linux users can read the [install instructions](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/#install-compose) or can install via pip:
```
pip install docker-compose
```

### Windows
Please note that this repo has scripting that's written in `bash`. What this means is the containers that are linux based
are expecting linux style line endings. If you clone this repo and you have windows style line endings, then please
read [The case of Windows line-ending in bash-script](https://techblog.dorogin.com/case-of-windows-line-ending-in-bash-script-7236f056abe). We've included the `.gitattributes` file in this project to help alliviate any issues. But you might need to make
git global config settings.

* Windows Users must set the following 2 ENV vars:
  * `COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=1`
  * `PWD=/path/to/checkout/for/stack-docker`
    * for example I use the path: `/c/Users/nick/elastic/stack-docker`
    * Note: you're paths must be in the form of `/c/path/to/place` using `C:\path\to\place` will not work
  * You can set these two ways:
    1. Temporarily add an env var in powershell use: `$Env:COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS=1`
    2. Permanently add an env var in powershell use: `[Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("COMPOSE_CONVERT_WINDOWS_PATHS", "1", "Machine")`
      > Note: you will need to refresh or create a new powershell for this env var to take effect
    3. in System Properties add the environment variables.


* At least 4GiB of RAM for the containers. Windows and Mac users _must_
configure their Docker virtual machine to have more than the default 2 GiB of
RAM:

![Docker VM memory settings](screenshots/docker-vm-memory-settings.png)

* Linux Users must set the following configuration as `root`:

```
sysctl -w vm.max_map_count=262144
```
By default, the amount of Virtual Memory [is not enough](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/vm-max-map-count.html).


## Starting the stack

First we need to:

1. set default password
2. Create SSL certs
3. create keystores to store passwords
4. install dashboards, index patterns, etc.. for beats and apm

This is accomplished using the setup.yml file:
```
docker-compose -f setup/setup.yml run --rm setup
```

Please take note after the setup completes it will output the password
that is used for the `elastic` login.

*Please note* that this repository makes the assumption that you will be cloneing the repository into a directory
named `stack-docker`. If you choose to name the directory something else upon cloneing or after, you will have
to specify the `-p stack-docker` flag when running `docker-compose` commands (aside from the setup command).

From the docker-compose help:
```
-p, --project-name NAME     Specify an alternate project name
                              (default: directory name)
```

Now we can launch the stack with `docker-compose up -d` to create a demonstration Elastic Stack with
Elasticsearch, Kibana, Logstash, Auditbeat, Metricbeat, Filebeat, Packetbeat,
and Heartbeat.

Point a browser at [`http://localhost:5601`](http://localhost:5601) to see the results.
> *NOTE*: Elasticsearch is now setup with self-signed certs.
> This means anytime you want to interact with elasticsearch by using other tools/clients you must use
> https, and if you want to get the `ca.crt` you can get it by running
> `docker exec -it elasticsearch cat /usr/share/elasticsearch/config/certs/ssl/ca/ca.crt`


Log in with `elastic` and what ever your auto generated elastic password is from the
setup.
